This website has been done for the Udacity Front end Nanodegree program second challenge. 

This is a dynamic landing page. It includes javascript for dynamic menu creation, as well as for some others dynamic features (for instance know where you are while scrolling).

As A beginner this is just the fist version of it. Many of the code implementation are not satisfying. 

It is a good start for later improving.
